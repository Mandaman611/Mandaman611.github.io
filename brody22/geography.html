			<h1>Geography Object</h1>
			<p>Used to allow radar controllers to see some of the terrain that their pilots will be facing.  This is particularly useful for controlling Visual Flight Rules (VFR) traffic, allowing a controller to give adequete terrain calls, and other advisories to ensure pilots stay well clear of the area.Geography objects, or EOVM Objects are very useful to radar controllers, because the controllers cannot see the airplanes, or how close they are to terrain.  This provides an idea for the controllers on where the airplane is in comparison to the terrain.</p><br/>
