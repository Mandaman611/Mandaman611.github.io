			<h1>Radar Target</h1>
			<p>A radar target, on the radar scope of a radar controller represents an aircraft.  These radar targets show position laterally, and their datablocks show their position vertically, in addition to other useful information for the controller to know, such as aircraft type, assigned temporary altitude, assigned heading, assigned fix, and other information.  Without radar targets, controllers would have no idea where the aircraft are.  These are the little "blips" on the radar screen that make everything work.</p><br/>
