			<h1>Range Ring</h1>
			<p>Range rings are small grey circles on the screen of a radar controller that allow them to quickly measure the distance between to objects.  When set to a specific differing radius, for example, 5 miles, controllers can see that an aircraft is two rings away from the airport, and know that they are 10 miles from it, rather than measuring it manually.  This allows for faster control, as it is more easily visible.</p><br/>
