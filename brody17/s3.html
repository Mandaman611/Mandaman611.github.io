			<h3>S3 Training (TRACON)</h3>
			<h4>Introduction to TRACON</h4>
			<p>TRACON, standing for <strong>T</strong>erminal <strong>R</strong>adar <strong>A</strong>pproach <strong>CON</strong>trol, contains two positions, Approach control, and Departure control.  Both radar controllers, Approach and Departure controllers handle the departing and arriving aircraft in the immediate vicinity of their arrival airport.  There are many TRACON sectors across the US, all staffed by radar controllers whose job it is to guide aircraft from the ground to the edge of their airspace, and from the air, to the ground.</p>
			<h5>Departure Control</h5>
			<p>A departure controller's primary responsibility is to efficiently get aircraft from outside of Tower's airspace to a point at which the aircraft is established on its filed route, and clear of any traffic, prior to handing the aircraft off to Centre. In addition to this they are also responsible for providing Safety Alerts as required.<p>
			<p>Departure controllers handle aircraft from around 1,500 feet in the air, to wherever the top of their airspace is, often around 20,000 feet.  They will guide them from the moment they are handed off from tower, to the moment they hand them off to Centre.<p>
			<h5>Approach Control</h5>
			<p>An approach controller's primary reponsibility is to get the aircraft from the en-route environment to the tower environment as efficiently as possible. They are also responsible for issuing Safety Alerts as required and coordination with the appropriate controllers.<p>
			<p>Approach controllers handle aircraft entering the TRACON airspace, and properly guide them until they are lined up with the runway, and ready to land.</p>
