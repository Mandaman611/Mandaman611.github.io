                            <p>Once up and out of bed (not easy in allergy season) I am in constant motion. I like things that move: Airplanes, horses, boats. And I love making them move. I work one afternoon a week at Bergen Equestrian Center to help pay for riding lessons. I like the communication part of horsemanship. I guess I'm a control freak. I'm deeply involved in the online air-traffic control universe of VATSIM. It's an immersive multi-participant simulation of actual airspace where pilots and controllers interact in real time, according to true rules. I'm taking an online pilot training course as well. I write code (Java, Python, HTML, others...) and enjoy its ability to make stuff happen. Programming is power. Piloting is power. They are closely related.</p>
                            <p>I was a competitive gymnast until it got too dangerous and took up too much time (4 nights a week plus meets on weekends). I have studied Isshin-ryu karate for more than 8 years and am a 3rd degree brown belt. Again, all about power and control. I have a twin. She, too, is a samurai - and a former gymnast. We both do volunteer work for kids with special needs through District 6 Challenger Baseball League. And we both have led horses in the equine therapy program at Pony Power Therapies whose clients are mostly autistic kids and adults with PTSD. </p>
                            <p>Looking toward the future, a lot of things will happen when I turn 16. I can get my black belt in karate and complete solo flight. Then there's the whole game that is getting into a good college. Because knowledge is power to move up.</p>
