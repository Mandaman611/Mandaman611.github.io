		<h3>In the beginning...</h3>
		
		<p>
   		

    		The Internet and email have both been around for some time now. <br>
    		The initial Internet was actually developed by the US military <br>
    		as a means of communication that was impossible to break! It was <br>
    		thought that if there were thousands of communication points <br>
    		(rather than just a few transmitters) then it would be possible <br>
    		to transmit a message even when many communication points had <br>
    		been destroyed. No-one imagined that the Internet would become <br>
    		a house-hold tool for many people throughout the world! <br>
		</p>
		
    		<h3>The World-Wide-Web</h3>
		
		<p>
    		Until 1989, the Internet was primarily used by computer geeks <br>
    		who knew all the required tools and commands. But everything <br>
    		changed when Tim Berners-Lee of the <em>CERN nuclear research facility </em> <br>
    		near Geneva, Switzerland, introduced Hypertext documents. <br>

    		Hypertext documents made it very simple to follow links to related <br>
    		information, regardless of which country the information is stored <br>
    		in - all that was required was a single click of the mouse! Yet <br>
    		these links also had an implication for the way people would read <br>
    		the information...
