		<h2>Reviews of Now You See Me</h2>
		<p>Clever, original, enjoyable and directed with dazzle, the film combines the pleasure of a heist movie with a plot full of wit, double-takes and sleight-of-camera, as well as hand.  Now You See Me was by far the best movie I've seen in a while.  Definately worth seeing.  Recommend this to all ages.</p>
