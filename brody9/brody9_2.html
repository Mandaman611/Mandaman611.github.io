		<h1>History of the United States Navy</h1>
		<p>Since its birth on October 13, 1775, the Navy has been involved with more than ten major wars and countless battles in the effort to bring security, democracy, peace and prosperity to the American people. It's stood as a constant deterrent against international aggression. Acted as a willing source of assistance to those in crisis or need around the globe. And moved humanity forward through everything from action to innovation.</p>
