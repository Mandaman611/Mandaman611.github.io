		Here we'll initialize the array, using a 3 value format.  We'll use associative arrays to make each airline have a name, a country, and a founding year.  
		Mess with it as you will, but keep it uniform.  If you have the first value as names, keep the first value as names in ALL OF THEM.  You'll break your code, and I'll laugh.

		Sample Data Entry:
		["Airline Name", "Airline Country", YearFounded]

		Using 2D arrays for data management purposes.  Information on 2D arrays: http://www.quackit.com/javascript/tutorial/two_dimensional_arrays.cfm
		This 2D array uses 3 values, rather than 2...  Call it a 3D array, if you'd like.
		
		You unfortunately have to do some work, in the form of data entry...  No XML or JSON support yet, we'll see about an API.
		
		I've truncated these airlines if they had the word "airline(s)" to end them, as I found it rather redundant.
		The application	does not account for this change, so changing "Alaska" to "Alaska Airlines" will require the user to input this full name.
