                <p>
                    We are the Women's Rights organization... We are currently fighting for women to have equal rights as men. More specifically, we are currently working on the temperance movement. Alcohol is a viscous substance that gains control of men to make them abusive. Drunkenness is a problem. We are the poor wives of these drunkards and the poor victims of their actions. Support our fight against limiting alcohol! We are also fighting for higher education for women. It is time to allow women to have the same education as men and to be able to gain further knowledge. There are currently academically rigorous schools open to women which are facing much opposition. Join our fight to open more women and coeducational schools! We are capable of learning too!
