                    We are the Women's Rights organization... Here are our slogans:
                </p>
                <p>
                    “No man is good enough to govern any woman without her consent” - Susan B Anthony 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to obtain our rights, we need to unite and fight.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="cause">
                <h3>About our Cause</h3>
                <p>
                    We are currently fighting for women to have equal rights as men. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In particular, we are fighting for higher education for women. It is time to allow women to have the same education as men and to be able to further their knowledge. There are currently academically rigorous schools open to women such as Troy Female Seminary which are facing much opposition.  In addition, we want to assure that women have the right to vote, to own property, and to fight against the evils of slavery.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    As women, we also want to address the temperance movement. Alcohol is a dangerous substance that gains control of men and makes them act abusively. Drunkenness is a problem. We are the poor wives of these drunkards and the victims of their actions. Support our fight to limit alcohol!
                    Overall, to join our cause, you can help in many ways such as raising money, passing out literature, and collecting signatures for our petitions to Congress.
