			<h2>Note</h2>
			<p>
				I chose to write about Master Chief Giordano because as the new Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy, there are many things about him that haven't been published by sources other than official military websites.  In addition I am very intersted in the Navy and as he is a "new face" in the Navy Staff, it was an easy choice.  I look forward to seeing what MCPON Giordano chooses to change about the Navy.
